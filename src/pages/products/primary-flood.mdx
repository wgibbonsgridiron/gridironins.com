## Why Choose Private Flood Over NFIP?

### Higher Coverage Limits
NFIP caps building coverage at $500,000 and contents at $500,000 for commercial properties. Our private market flood insurance offers limits up to [$AMOUNT], protecting your full property value.

### Replacement Cost Coverage
Unlike NFIP's actual cash value (depreciated) coverage for many items, we offer full replacement cost coverage for buildings and contents.

### Broader Covered Property
We cover items that NFIP excludes or limits, such as:
- Property in basements (limited under NFIP)
- Detached structures
- Swimming pools
- Landscaping (limited coverage available)
- Additional structures on premises

### Lower Deductibles
Flexible deductible options starting at [$AMOUNT], compared to NFIP's higher mandatory deductibles in many flood zones.

### Additional Living Expense / Business Income
Coverage for loss of income and extra expenses during flood-related closures—not available under NFIP.

</div>

## Flood Zone Determination

Our platform automatically determines flood zone using:

1. **FEMA Flood Maps** - Current FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
2. **First Street Foundation Data** - Advanced flood modeling including climate projections
3. **USGS Elevation Data** - High-resolution terrain models
4. **Historical Claims Data** - Actual loss experience in the area

This multi-source approach provides more accurate risk assessment than FEMA maps alone.

---

## Elevation Requirements

For properties in high-risk flood zones (A, AE, VE), we require:

- **Elevation Certificate** - Showing the building's lowest floor elevation relative to Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
- **Building Compliance** - Documentation that structure meets or exceeds local building codes
- **Floodproofing Measures** - Details of any floodproofing or flood mitigation measures in place

Properties with lowest floor elevation above BFE qualify for significantly reduced premiums.

---

## Premium Factors

Flood insurance premiums are determined by:

1. **Flood Zone** - Higher risk zones (A, AE, VE) have higher rates than lower risk zones (B, C, X)
2. **Elevation** - Buildings above BFE receive substantial discounts
3. **Construction Type** - Elevated structures, flood-resistant materials earn credits
4. **Deductible** - Higher deductibles reduce premium
5. **Coverage Limits** - Amount of building and contents coverage
6. **Building Age & Condition** - Newer buildings with modern construction may qualify for better rates
7. **Prior Losses** - Flood loss history affects pricing

---

## Deductible Options

**Standard Deductibles:** [$AMOUNT], [$AMOUNT], [$AMOUNT], [$AMOUNT], [$AMOUNT]

**Percentage Deductibles:** 2%, 3%, 5% of building limit (available for larger properties)

Lower deductibles available for properties with minimal flood risk.

---
